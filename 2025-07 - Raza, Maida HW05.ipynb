    "\n",
    "In this assignment, I worked with decision trees to classify data using different feature selection heuristics. I began by computing and comparing the counting and information-theoretic heuristics on a small toy dataset. Then, I applied the same heuristics to a simplified version of the abalone dataset and trained decision tree classifiers on both the full and simplified data using sklearn. I evaluated the models, visualized the trees using Graphviz, and analyzed their accuracy and structure.\n",
